another link dump, some of these have been open for months and need to be closed or forgotten. It's healthy to pay down the tab debt at least once a quarter.

- [10 Years of Meteor](https://meteor10.sachagreif.com/)
    - meteor had some good parts but missed the mark on several. I didn't care for meteor at the time, but did go on to use Apollo GraphQL heavily at Credit Karma. It was ok, but perhaps overly complicated.
    - [Sidebar](https://sidebar.io/)
        - linked from the meteor piece, it's a daily link aggregator
- [Body Margin 8px | Miriam Eric Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/07/04/body-margin-8px/)
    - a few too many words on the history of browser resets, specifically the 8px body margin
- [auth-helpers/packages/nextjs at main · supabase-community/auth-helpers](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/packages/nextjs?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=218642387&utm_content=218642387&utm_source=hs_email#migrating-from-supabasesupabase-auth-helpers-to-supabaseauth-helpers)
    - supabase might have finally fixed their auth? I need to update this in [redacted]
- [The new wave of React state management](https://frontendmastery.com/posts/the-new-wave-of-react-state-management/)
    - everything is new, again. this time it's state management, because flow was fucked and redux is too repetitive, so we need more of these.
    - [pmndrs/zustand: 🐻 Bear necessities for state management in React](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) looks cool though
- [virgil/Overview.md at master · titzer/virgil](https://github.com/titzer/virgil/blob/master/doc/tutorial/Overview.md)
    - [redacted] has been designing a programming language, so I collected this to send to him
- [Google AI Blog: Minerva: Solving Quantitative Reasoning Problems with Language Models](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/06/minerva-solving-quantitative-reasoning.html)
    - more AI research for the pile.
- [Things You Should Know About Databases](https://architecturenotes.co/things-you-should-know-about-databases/)
    - I can't produce this knowledge a priori, but this tread over territory I was already familiar with from reading Martin Kleppmann's Warthog book. (Everyone should read the Warthog book.)
- [multiprocessio/datastation: App to easily query, script, and visualize data from every database, file, and API.](https://github.com/multiprocessio/datastation)
    - another notebook alternative. under-designed imo.
- [Tailscale · Best VPN Service for Secure Networks](https://tailscale.com/)
    - [redacted] is using this. But does look interesting, trad-VPN is so wasteful
- [One-liner for running queries against CSV files with SQLite | Simon Willison’s TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/one-line-csv-operations)
    - stoopid sqlite tricks
- [AddyOsmani.com - Software Engineering - The Soft Parts](https://addyosmani.com/blog/software-engineering-soft-parts/)
    - thoughtful post from Addy about being a human who also works with other humans and also computers
- [Notes on maintaining an internal React component library | Gabe's blog](https://www.gabe.pizza/notes-on-component-libraries/)
- [The Bill Gurley Chronicles: VCs, Marketplaces, and Early-Stage Investing](https://macro-ops.com/the-bill-gurley-chronicles-an-above-the-crowd-mba-on-vcs-marketplaces-and-early-stage-investing/)
    - This might be the single most informative blog post I have ever read. It summarizes 20 years of Bill Gurley's blog, which is just nugget after interesting nugget of shrewd analysis and galaxy-brain predictions that were more accurate than not.
- [CSS: Flexible Repeating SVG Masks](https://tylergaw.com/blog/css-repeating-svg-masks/)
    - [redacted] designed me something like this for [WebRTC.party](https://webrtc.party/) and I did my own half-baked version and then found this post. For next time.
- [I'm All-In on Server-Side SQLite · Fly](https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/)
    - more SQLite hype
- [Local warming - Works in Progress](https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/local-warming/)
    - I like the design. The content didn't stick with me, but the design did.
- [Elegant Six-Page Proof Reveals the Emergence of Random Structure | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/elegant-six-page-proof-reveals-the-emergence-of-random-structure-20220425/)
    - I always save the tab on this genre Math shit after I read half of it and move onto something else. I long for the timeline where I studied a bit harder and got the muscle memory worn into me to fully understand this realm instead of feeling like a lost child.
- [How to write more clearly, think more clearly, and learn complex material](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31060362)
- [How to Freaking Find Great Developers By Having Them Read Code | Freaking Rectangle](https://freakingrectangle.wordpress.com/2022/04/15/how-to-freaking-hire-great-developers/)
    - Lotsa people opine on how to do interviews, or otherwise bemoan the modern leetcode-style panel interview, but this is a novel hot take. Analyzing is better than synthesizing.
- [Reliably Send an HTTP Request as a User Leaves a Page | CSS-Tricks - CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/send-an-http-request-on-page-exit/)
    - Still hard to do! There's a built-in `ping` attribute on the anchor tag, but Firefox doesn't support it.
- [Agile and the Long Crisis of Software](https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/)
    - my favorite dead horse to beat: discourse on project management techniques! though this is a good history, the subject is fraught. It's a distraction from building.
- [What I learned as a hired consultant for autodidact physicists | Aeon Ideas](https://aeon.co/ideas/what-i-learned-as-a-hired-consultant-for-autodidact-physicists)
    - good germ of a story here
- [A Rust web server / frontend setup like it's 2022 (with axum and yew) | Robert Krahn](https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2022-04-03_rust-web-wasm/)
    - I deeply, deeply want to write Rust but feel like I can't ever afford to slow down and suffer through the learning curve. I just end up writing JavaScript (TypeScript).
- [Two-way writeups: Coda’s secret to shipping fast](https://coda.io/@lshackleton/two-way-writeups-coda-s-secret-to-shipping-fast)
    - hey look, more discourse on project management techniques! this is good though, coda makes good tools
- [Mapo Tofu | Cult Favorite](https://cult.st/recipes/mapo-tofu)
    - I want to cook this!
- [Sichuan(ish) Celery | Cult Favorite](https://cult.st/recipes/sichuanish-celery)
    - I want to cook this too!
- [The SPACE of Developer Productivity - ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124)
    - yet another piece adjacent to project management discourse. this time a framework to measure developer productivity. I discussed this with Sean in 2016/17 as being a multi-dimensional gradient descent problem.
- [Nadia Asparouhova | Idea machines](https://nadia.xyz/idea-machines)
    - "effective altruism"
- [set -e, -u, -o, -x pipefail explanation](https://gist.github.com/mohanpedala/1e2ff5661761d3abd0385e8223e16425)
    - I don't write bash as regularly as I used to (thank god) and I can never remember which of these I need to do. Bash is the pits.
