# Books, continued

Keeping reading lists year-over-year has been fun. This year felt a bit different. I was still reading a couple of holdovers from my 2017 list and simply didn't have the energy to create a new post for 2018. It felt unsustainable, like I was forcing it. So instead I'm following the lead of other smart folks who keep a single running list.

_Currently_

* [The Timeless Way of Building](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840013131) by Christoper Alexander. I never really put this one down from last year, the clarity of language and thought is unmatched. I foresee myself deep-reading (and re-reading) this for a long, long time.
* [2666](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216941696) by Roberto Bolaño. Keep at least one fiction book going at all times. The longer, the better. Started after finishing 100 Years of Solitude, staying on the theme of english translations of spanish lit.
* [The Workbench Book](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41071867) by Scott Landis and [Best Workbenches](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973537637) by the Editors of Fine Woodworking. I've taken on woodworking/joinery as hobby over the past year or so and a mentor recommended my next project be a cabinetmaker's workbench.
