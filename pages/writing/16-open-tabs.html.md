# I have 16 open tabs

Right now, I have 16 open tabs in my browser.

By all measures, this is not a lot of tabs. I see people at work that have tab stacks so dense only a single pixel is given to each one. Or multiple windows, 6 or 7 layers deep, each with 10 tabs or more, taking up the full width of the screen. I try and do better than that. 

I like to treat my browser—my work environment—with a little more respect by closing things down at the beginning or end of each day, or at very least once a week.

So that leaves my pc at home. That's where the tabs pile up, unread and unwanted, for weeks on end. I come back to them every day, occasionally adding to them, and sometimes nuking the whole session altogether.

But on any given day I have an accretion of internet detritus to ponder over. It was Jorge Luis Borges who said that reading is a more intellectual activity than writing; I never read most of them.

Here is the (annotated) list of tabs I currently have open:

* [Pinboard: popular bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/popular/) - I usually have this one open. It's replaced [the orange website](http://n-gate.com/hackernews/) and reddit for me. I don't bookmark very many things these days but I like the format of "a whole bunch of links" to peruse
* [Native lazy-loading for the web  |  web.dev](https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading) - haven't read this yet, sounds like I'll get to continue not writing lazy image loading code and get the whole thing backfilled for me by browser vendors
* [How to get your first 10 customers](http://danshipper.com/nothing-happens-until-the-sale-is-made) - a link from pinboard I kinda looked at and moved on from
* [Rust Language Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs/) - I bought the Rust book a few months ago and will use it in future projects, so this seems like a keeper
* [Netflix is not a tech company — Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/7/31/Netflix) - in general, I try to avoid thought leaders like Ben Evans, with the exception of him specifically, to be taken with a healthy amount of salt
* [Getting Real About Distributed System Reliability - Jay Kreps](https://blog.empathybox.com/post/19574936361/getting-real-about-distributed-system-reliability) - I haven't read this yet. I like horror stories about hard problems that involve lots of computers.
* [Nicomachean Ethics, by Aristotle. Translated by F. H. Peters - Standard Ebooks: Free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover.](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/aristotle/nicomachean-ethics/f-h-peters) - Nassim Nicholas Taleb turned me on to NICOMACHEAN ETHICS and it's some heavy shit. This is a free ebook version that's not completely fucked.
* [How to Write a Thesis, According to Umberto Eco | The MIT Press Reader](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/umberto-eco-how-to-write-a-thesis/) - big ups to Umberto Eco, whom I'm totally down with. FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM is a great read, as is his collection of essays, TRAVELS IN HYPERREALITY
* [Fast Software, the Best Software — by Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/) - this is a name I recognize and might be interesting. Skimmed the title and opened the tab.
* [History and effective use of Vim](https://begriffs.com/posts/2019-07-19-history-use-vim.html) - heavy nerd shit. An internet wrote about vim, nerds will read this and nitpick and drool.
* [Bookshelf · Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) - one of the brothers Stripe has a bookshelf that's ridiculously intimidating and also somewhat ridiculous. Stripe Press is dope thought
* [Daft Punk Live DJ Sets from the 90s](https://kottke.org/19/06/daft-punk-live-dj-sets-from-the-90s) - babby boomer blogger discovers old daft punk; I've had this one open for weeks
* [Startup idea checklist | defmacro](https://www.defmacro.org/2019/03/26/startup-checklist.html) - an (famous) internet has a do's / dont's list but like for startup ideas; who cares but it's probably worth consulting
* [Sixteen Years of Listening: My Audible Favorites - Ben Galbraith - Medium](https://medium.com/@bgalbs/sixteen-years-of-listening-my-audible-favorites-dc7386737cc5) - sick list of good audiobooks, for which I am a fiend. I plan on putting together a similar (running) list of my favorite because this is a good idea for a post, and exhibits demonstrably better curation than Audible ever has
* [Observability — A 3-Year Retrospective - The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/observability-a-3-year-retrospective/) - recommended by a colleague, to read
* [Nintendo Never Should Have Pandered To Women And Created A Female Mario](https://ogn.theonion.com/nintendo-never-should-have-pandered-to-women-and-create-1837027540) - satire from THE ONION surfaced to me by THE FACEBOOK
