# Books, continued

Keeping reading lists year-over-year has been fun. This year felt a bit different. I was still reading a couple of holdovers from my 2017 list and simply didn't have the energy to create a new post for 2018. It felt unsustainable, like I was forcing it. So instead I'm following the lead of other smart folks who keep a single running list.

_Currently_


* [Incerto](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/198481981X) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. A hardcover edition of 5 books that I already own. Taleb is one of a few writers good enough to buy multiple copies of when better editions come out. This is an excellent priting.
* [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1732265186) by Will Larson. Published by Stripe Press. This is a beatiful book.
* [The Timeless Way of Building](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840013131) by Christoper Alexander. I never really put this one down from last year, the clarity of language and thought is unmatched. I foresee myself deep-reading (and re-reading) this for a long, long time.
* [2666](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216941696) by Roberto Bolaño. Keep at least one fiction book going at all times; the longer, the better. Started after finishing 100 Years of Solitude, staying on the theme of english translations of spanish lit.
* [The Wind-up Bird Chronicle](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/747193445) by Haruki Murakami

I've taken on woodworking/joinery as hobby over the past year or so and a mentor recommended my next project be a cabinetmaker's workbench.
