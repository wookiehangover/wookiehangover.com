<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->January 1, 2017</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->I tried to read more this year, I really did. I had serious intentions about it, so I did what serious people do, I started keeping a list. Or at least I decided to publish it and keep it up to date. There was a natural satisfaction, an additional dopamine rush of accomplishment, to checking off an title right after I finished it.</p>

</a>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->I started on Wunderlist. Probably around the second half of 2015 enough static had built up around the problem to trigger a release, a single spasm of output into list form, tapped diligently onto the keyboard of my iPhone. That list, of things I was currently reading and thing I remembered reading up to that point in the year and books I had already purchased and were waiting for me on my bookshelf, was what source my 2015 post, which I still wrote in a hurry on New Year’s Day 2016.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->I kept up the practice of maintaining a reading list in Wunderlist. It unfurled itself ahead of me and pushed the past books forever below the fold. I got ambitious a couple of times and added dozens of titles, so many in fact that the list became a burden. I couldn’t look at it. And the format, for however much it rewarded me with the initial thrill of checking off a title, downplayed the previous items in a way that was a little unsatisfying. I had also taken to using Wunderlist (which I love, btw, despite the criticism) for work task tracking, so it became a thing that now did two things, which is far to many functions for my limbic brain to remember how to reward. So I let that list wither a little until finally I abandoned it entirely.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->That’s when I finally re-did my website and by doing a classic thing-you-shouldn’t-do and rolled my own publishing software from scratch. Mostly so I could maintain a list in markdown, which, I kinda did?</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Last year’s was a Medium post. Medium is great. I’m mad jellz of what they built. But I like writing in thick app, and I like writing in markdown, and I like being able to keep and move around my own files.<sup><!-- -->1</sup></p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->So I once again went through the act of translating my reading history from Wunderlist into a more sharable format. Hence the list you’ll find archived at the bottom of this post.<sup><!-- -->2</sup></p>
<h3 class="dark-gray sans-serif fw3"><!-- -->How to read this list:</h3>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Because decisions are hard, I’ve gone through the trouble of preparing a few variations:</p>
<ol><!-- -->
<li class=""><!-- -->The “Classic” list, as maintained in earlier versions of this post. If you don’t like introspective bullshit, skip to this one — <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="2016-reading-list.html"><!-- -->Classic List</a></li>
<li class=""><!-- -->The Esoteric List, my first thoughts on how to properly formulate a wrap up post that sums up my life this year — <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="#so-you-like-books-huh-"><!-- -->Esoteric</a></li>
<li class=""><!-- -->Up / down recommendations, my no frills recommendations: read it or skip it — <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="#up-down"><!-- -->Up/Down</a></li>
</ol>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->I now present these, out of order:</p>
<h3 class="dark-gray sans-serif fw3"><!-- -->So you like books, huh?</h3>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Fuck man, this was a hell of a year, wasn’t it? I’ve probably said that exact phrase a couple of dozen times in the waning days of 2016. But, fuck, man, wasn’t it tho?</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->While trying to narrowly avoid <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_emigration"><!-- -->inner emigration</a>, I’ve put myself on a full press embargo after the months of frenzy leading up to the US Presidential Election: I’m terrified that the 24 hour news cycle is designed only to distract, and there’s very little to distinguish honest journalism from partisan hackery in the echo chambers we’ve spent the last few years building for ourselves.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->So I read some fuckin books.</p>
<h3 class="dark-gray sans-serif fw3"><!-- -->Fiction</h3>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->I read three pieces of fiction this year that stand out. None were published any time recently. They have with very little to do with one another, save for that <em><!-- -->Flow My Tears…</em> and <em><!-- -->Cat’s Cradle</em> could loosely be thrown into the Science Fiction section at a used bookstore and no crime would have been committed, and I enjoyed each one of them for entirely different reasons.</p>
<ul><!-- -->
<li class=""><a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/Flow-My-Tears-Policeman-Said/dp/0547572255/"><em><!-- -->Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</em></a> by Philip K. Dick ★★★★☆</li>
</ul>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Philip K. Dick often wrote about  men who suddenly find themselves out of place, where their underlying assumptions about the world are either slowly subverted if not turned entirely upside down. <em><!-- -->Flow My Tears…</em> is one of the latter.</p>
<ul><!-- -->
<li class=""><a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X/"><em><!-- -->Cat’s Cradle</em>: A Novel</a> by Kurt Vonnegut ★★★★★</li>
</ul>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Kurt Vonnegut knows how to keep things brief and always remembers to include a punchline. And there’s a main character in this book with the same last name as me, go figure why I liked it. You should read this, it’s short and funny and leaves you thinking about big questions about humanity. And Ice-9.</p>
<ul><!-- -->
<li class=""><a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Gods-Tenth-Anniversary-Novel/dp/0062472100/"><em><!-- -->American Gods</em></a> by Neil Gaiman ★★★★☆</li>
</ul>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Neil Gaiman is not an author that I’ve ever really gotten into. He seems like a soft spoken British man who spins somewhat boring stories infused with “magick” and “faeries’ or something like that, right? Either way, I was probably quick to judge Gaiman on his observable aesthetic and film adaptations. American Gods is great.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->More importantly, these three works bring into question the notion of identity: in <em><!-- -->Flow My Tears…</em>, the protagonists celebrity identity is stripped away in an instant with no explanation; <em><!-- -->Cat’s Cradle</em> centers around a group of people failing to understand each other and their means of relating to the world, all while foolishly toying with scientific advances that carry devastating consequences; finally, American Gods serves as modern mythology-cum-Bildungsroman and is about a character literally named “Shadow” who’s piecing together his present version of himself from fractured memories of his past life while struggling to separate reality from fantasy or illusion.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Phew, ok, that was a mouthful. On with the rest of the list.</p>
<h3 class="dark-gray sans-serif fw3"><!-- -->Non-Fiction</h3>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Last year’s wrap up post was assembled in a hurry, and while I certainly had chosen a few vectors in my non-fiction selections, I had of course done it somewhat haphazardly. I largely discovered the things on my 2015 list myself by way of the internet. In 2016 I went about it a bit differently<sup><!-- -->2</sup> and I’m pleased with the results.</p>
<ul><!-- -->
<li class=""><a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Valley-Birth-Personal-Computer/dp/1937785769/"><em><!-- -->Fire in the Valley</em>: The Birth and Death of the Personal Computer</a> by Michael Swaine and Paul Freiberger ★★★★★</li>
</ul>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->If you work in tech, read this book. <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="2016-reading-list.html#fire-in-the-valley-details"><!-- -->See previously</a></p>
<ul><!-- -->
<li class=""><a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Fooled-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/0399590455/"><em><!-- -->Incerto</em></a> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb ★★★★★
<em><!-- --> <em><!-- -->Fooled By Randomness</em>
</em> <em><!-- -->The Black Swan</em>
* <em><!-- -->Antifragile</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->The last thing I expected to find this year was yet another author to do a deep-dive into, but Nassim Taleb is my man this year. I picked up Antifragile in February based off of Joe’s glowing recommendation. I had recalled seeing the covers of Fooled By Randomness and The Black Swan in bookstores in recent years, but I glibly assumed that they were of the Malcom Gladwell variety of disposable pop-science / psychology non ficton, full of bluster and anecdote but otherwise lacking in anything concrete. Similar to the genre of business books, but for people who think they’re smarter than people who read business books.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Boy was I wrong.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Full of bluster: yes. Taleb is absurdly bumptious, but in a way that I find endearing. Lacking in content: hardly. The only similarity to cheapie business books is some of the repetitiveness in the arguments being presented, but that’s at best a superficial criticism. I poured through <em><!-- -->Antifragile</em>, the cumulative argument in the <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Fooled-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/0399590455/"><em><!-- -->Incerto</em></a> series, but the the prologue assured me that I wouldn’t need to read the previous three volumes as a prerequisite to grokking the subject matter.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->After reading <em><!-- -->Antifragile</em> I let its ideas stew in my brain for a few months, as I dug through other non-fiction in nearby fields and concepts, particularly by Niall Ferguson. But <em><!-- -->Antifragile</em> kept on bugging me. I wanted to re-read it.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->The fundamental asymmetries that exist between what we think we know and everything else in the universe, and we’re hardwired to misinterpret events. As a species we excel at <em><!-- -->predicting the past</em> and are generally terrible at keeping score when we make predictions about the future — and our past losses can always be  summarized in convenient and intelligent-sounding justifications.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Around that same time I started following Nassim Taleb on twitter (worth it) and that he had recently published <a class="dark-red link bb hover-red" href="https://www.amazon.com/Incerto-Fooled-Randomness-Procrustes-Antifragile/dp/0399590455/"><em><!-- -->Incerto</em></a> as a handsome box of paperbacks. Sold. Also gave as a gift to a few smartypants people I know.</p>
<p class="lh-copy mv3"><!-- -->Presented as a series of essays, anecdotes, and diatribes, with copious footnotes and even a technical essay or two, <em><!-- -->Fooled By Randomness</em>, <em><!-- -->The Black Swan</em>, and <em><!-- -->Antifragile</em> just about made my anti-academic year, and are now prized possessions on my bookshelf. I look forward to finishing <em><!-- -->Bed of Procrustes</em> this year and to re-reading the series again in the future. I’ve never encountered so many powerful and challenging ideas all in one place. It’s a piece of non-fiction that begs to be read for pleasure over and over again, just like a good sci-fi or fantasy series would. Amazing.</p>
