<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="16"><!-- react-text: 17 -->In January of 2007 I was 20 years old.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 18 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="19"><!-- react-text: 20 -->I had no job.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 21 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="22"><!-- react-text: 23 -->I couldn&#x27;t pay for college and simultaneously failed out.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 24 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="25"><!-- react-text: 26 -->Then I got a dui.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 27 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="28"><!-- react-text: 29 -->Then I wrecked my car.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 30 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="31"><!-- react-text: 32 -->With no license. And no insurance. And in an accident with another car. I had to beg my brother to loan me money to fix the other person&#x27;s car. Meanwhile my car sat unmoving and wrecked, collecting parking tickets until I sold it as-is for next to nothing.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 33 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="34"><!-- react-text: 35 -->When I did get a job, it only paid $9 an hour. For 32 hours a week. Technically part time.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 36 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="37"><!-- react-text: 38 -->I didn&#x27;t have health insurance. I watched Prince perform the Super Bowl halftime show in the ER waiting room. I had a fever for 3 days and my tonsils were so swollen I could hardly breathe.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 39 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="40"><!-- react-text: 41 -->It would be 3 years before I would pay the bill for the ER visit that night, which would tarnish my credit score for years afterwards.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 42 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="43"><!-- react-text: 44 -->The $12,000 tuition that I owed the school was sent to collections, which I ignored for 4 years and 20% annual interest in late fees.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 45 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="46"><!-- react-text: 47 -->My girlfriend and I got good at grocery store math pretty quick, because having to put stuff back after it was rung up was mortifying. A year earlier I had been living off a trust fund. They payments stopped that winter.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 48 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="49"><!-- react-text: 50 -->2007 was the worst year of my life.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 51 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="52"><!-- react-text: 53 -->But it was also one of the best.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 54 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="55"><!-- react-text: 56 -->2007 was the year I moved in with my then-girlfriend (and now-wife.)<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 57 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="58"><!-- react-text: 59 -->I got promoted to assistant manager at the retail job. My pay was raised to $11 dollars an hour, and I would get 36 hours a week on the schedule. That extra $108 a week was a lot of money. It meant less math at the grocery store.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 60 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="61"><!-- react-text: 62 -->My wife and I adopted a beat up little shelter dog that winter and named him Jack. He&#x27;s still here, but now he&#x27;s old and cranky after 10 years of being doted on and loved unconditionally.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 63 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="64"><!-- react-text: 65 -->2007 was the year I started riding a bike (for transportation, then for fun) and picked up skateboarding again (for fun, then for transportation.)<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 66 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="67"><!-- react-text: 68 -->2007 was the year I started taking any job on any film shoot I could find. Most of them were unpaid, on the hope of paid gigs in the future.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 69 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="70"><!-- react-text: 71 -->And 2007 was the year I started to code.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 72 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="73"><!-- react-text: 74 -->I used the money from selling the car to buy a white plastic MacBook. My PowerBook from college had finally died that fall. I remember tracking the shipment from the pc in the back office at work and racing home on my bike during my lunch so the package wouldn&#x27;t get stolen.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 75 -->
<!-- /react-text --><blockquote class="f3 mv3 i mh0 pl3 bl lh-title b--rainbows" data-reactid="76"><!-- react-text: 77 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="78"><!-- react-text: 79 -->It was the first computer I would get paid to write code on.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 80 -->
<!-- /react-text --></blockquote><!-- react-text: 81 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="82"><!-- react-text: 83 -->I was so excited to get that computer. I used it to climb out of debt and into a career I love. In 2007 I would write my first website and re-discover the love of building stuff on the internet that I had honed a decade earlier on Geocities and Tripod and Angelfire (and later, MySpace profiles.)<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 84 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="85"><!-- react-text: 86 -->That year I listened to MGMT, Peter, Bjorn and John, and Kanye West. I can remember riding my bike to those albums as fall in Boulder started to turn cold.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 87 -->
<!-- /react-text --><hr class="mv4" data-reactid="88"/><!-- react-text: 89 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="90"><!-- react-text: 91 -->Across town, TechStars would host its first class. A year later one of those companies would be acquired AOL for seven figures. I&#x27;d find out about this well after it happened. At a local tech meetup the founder, who was only a year or two older than me, ended his presentation by throwing $500 in singles into the air.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 92 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="93"><!-- react-text: 94 -->That guy is still around and I still hate him for doing that. It made me feel so worthless. I didn&#x27;t have a job in tech yet, despite wanting one, and was only slightly better off than I had been a year earlier. And here comes some jerkoff that was first given money for a fucking <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="95"><!-- react-text: 96 -->idea<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 97 --> and then fucking <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="98"><!-- react-text: 99 -->sold<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 100 --> that idea for even more money!<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 101 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="102"><!-- react-text: 103 -->A year earlier I was excited to get a raise for less money than he just threw on the ground.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 104 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="105"><!-- react-text: 106 -->That night fueled my resolve to work as hard as I could to never feel that way again. Poor and put out. An outsider looking in. And it gave me a model of something I never wanted to do.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 107 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="108"><!-- react-text: 109 -->I saw a tweet from that guy today. It got me thinking about that night and the terribly un-fun year before it. The funny thing is that he doesn&#x27;t even know me. But he pissed me off so badly a decade ago that I&#x27;m still stewing about it now.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 110 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="111"><!-- react-text: 112 -->But that night wasn&#x27;t all bad.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 113 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="114"><!-- react-text: 115 -->That was also the night I would meet Ingrid, who would eventually be my co-founder at Quick Left. But we wouldn&#x27;t know that for another year. We just hung out and talked about bikes and software.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 116 -->
<!-- /react-text --><p class="lh-copy mv3" data-reactid="117"><!-- react-text: 118 -->And maybe I owe something to the guy who threw the money after all. After that I started hustling for web design jobs on craigslist and less than a year later I would have a full time job. That job turned into Quick Left, a company that I would become a founder of and lead for 6 years.<!-- /react-text --></p><!-- react-text: 119 -->
