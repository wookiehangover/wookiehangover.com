  <h2>01. web log</h2>

  <p>This is a blog, sort of. Though I'm not planning on writing in it very
    ofen, I felt it important to keep a place for the occasional thought or
    two. All technical posts will still go up on the <a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/author/sam-breed">Quick Left blog</a>.
  </p>

  <p>To get started, here are some short biographies of people that I admire. These are included from
    Wikipedia without a citation.</p>

  <p>William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin OM, GCVO, PC, PRS, PRSE, (26 June 1824
    – 17 December 1907) was an Irish-born British mathematical physicist and
    engineer. He did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity
    and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did
    much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form.</p>

  <p>Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 — February 24, 2001) was an American
    mathematician, electronic engineer, and cryptographer known as "The father of
    Information Theory". Shannon is famous for having founded Information
    Theory with one landmark paper that he published in 1948. However, he is also
    credited with founding both digital computer and digital circuit design theory
    in 1937, when, as a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology (MIT), he wrote his thesis demonstrating that
    electrical applications of boolean algebra could construct and resolve any
    logical, numerical relationship.</p>

  <p>Thomas Ruggles Pynchon, Jr. (born May 8, 1937) is an American novelist.
    A MacArthur Fellow, he is noted for his dense and complex novels. Both his
    fiction and non-fiction writings encompass a vast array of subject matter,
    styles and themes, including (but not limited to) the fields of history,
    science, and mathematics. For his most praised novel, Gravity's Rainbow,
    Pynchon won the 1974 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. Pynchon is also
    known for being very private; very few photographs of him have ever been
    published, and rumors about his location and identity have circulated since
    the 1960s.</p>
