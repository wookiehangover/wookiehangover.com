## Making things for fun

This is not a blog—it's a fun side-project done over a couple weekends. It's not a blog because it's not using any blogging software, per se, just some elbow grease and [a few scripts][1] that I've managed to string together into a mostly-working state.

Simple products are fashionable these days, especially when it comes to media consumption. Even I've been known to write a Medium post every now and again, but I didn't set out to build this as a monument to simplicity. This isn't that type of place and I'm not that type of fella.

This is just a barely functioning, loosely coherent website with weird cursor effects<sup>[1][footnote1]</sup> (unless I've gotten bored and removed them) and footnotes<sup>[2][footnote2]</sup> (I probably haven't removed these.)

So why go through all the trouble to build this in the first place?

Isn't this what all developers inevitably do anyway? Build some crappy knock-off of good software because they're ego is too big to use anything that's not been graced to have sprung unbidden from their god-like cheeto-covered fingertips? Yes, let's all create something second rate instead of using something off-the-shelf in order to scratch the proverbial itch? Why, yes. Yes, it's probably something like that.

The question might as well then become, "why build anything at all?"

I made this because it was fun. It was more fun figuring out how to [easily inline all the assets][2] and [strip out unused css][3] on this page than it would have been to set up Wordpress again. The first time I ever set up Wordpress in 2008 was a magical and transcendent experience, so why am I so quick to shun it now? Wordpress is great software and I can't make anything that comes close to it in a weekend.

_Doing something from scratch, even if it's not polished, doesn't deny or invalidate what you've done in the past._

For a long time I refused to do any writing on my website because I felt like I didn't have the time. I was afraid that anything I wrote would be bad and then I'd be committed to it forever, comma splices and all. Paranoia that I would look back on it later with utter embarrassment kept me from committing to much writing since I killed my [first blog][5] in 2008. What I guess I means is I'm over that now? [Worse is better][4] after all, so why not let the shitposts start flowing!

In keeping with that spirit, I've shoddily rebuild Jekyll so that I can have reasonable writing experience for myself, which means markdown and not much else to fuss over. I'm unburdened by the need for SEO or any other unspeakable non-sense, but I care about mobile web and I care about pagespeed so I've gone and done the aforementioned asset inlining, which I think has come out quite nicely.

Go out and make something, even if it's a shoddy facsimile of something else.

(And, yes, I do plan on building an HTML guest book some day. But for now a link to twitter will have to suffice ;)

      The custom cursors (provided they're still here, if not, I'll include a gif) were a fun idea I gleaned from [@kwuchu][6] tweeting about redesigning his portfolio site, which featured a similarly cropped picture of him. Since I already had the avatar of my face cropped out, I threw it on the header to see how it would look. It was static and unmoving and no fun whatsoever. I don't know how I stumbled into the custom cursor CSS, but I definitely used [David Walsh's blog post][7] to see it in action and grok how it should work. Then [@ohhoe][8] asked my to make sparkle trails and I couldn't say "no" to that.

      Who doesn't love a good footnote? If you know someone, submit their names to me in writing and I'll add them to my list.
