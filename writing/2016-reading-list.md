      <summary>_The Illuminatus! Trilogy_ — Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson</summary>
      <p>I've read this before and I absolutely love it. Pure sci-fi zanyness with enough acid trips, talking dolphins, and fractal structure make it prime re-reading material, allowing for the slow jokes to play out with more more anticipation and certainly with more perspective to better take in the instant shifts betweens characters and timelines.</p>

      <summary>~~_American Gods_ – Neil Gaiman~~</summary>
      <p>Finally, finally got around to reading this after letting it languish on my Kindle for several years. Recommended by both my wife and best friend, I was pleased to so quickly become completely immersed in it. Gaiman creates moody settings that feel rich without going into Stephen King–levels of hyper-detail.</p>

      <p>I did have a funny note about Laura, though. Is it just me does she mostly serve as a corpse-ified version a manic pixie dreamgirl?</p>

       <summary>~~_The Killing Moon_ – N.K. Jemisin~~</summary>
       <p>I bought this based on an enthusiastic employee recommendation placard at Borderlands Books in San Francisco but set it down less than a quarter of the way into it for reasons I can no longer recall. I decided to pick it up again this year and loved it.</p>

       <p>Jemisin is a creator of vivid universes: they pull you into their orbit until they envelop you completely, at which point you'll find yourself thumbing back to previous chapters scanning for the precious and minute x devices that do so well to establish an _exact_ tone and setting. There's just enough narrative white space to contrast with the hyper-detailed emotional awareness of the characters and settings so that the story is framed with elaborate societal backstory that has clear eye-line to the sequel(s). Great sci-fi recommendation.</p>
