      <summary>_The Illuminatus! Trilogy_ — Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson</summary>

      <p>I've read this before and I absolutely love it. Pure sci-fi zanyness with enough acid trips, talking dolphins, and fractal structure make it prime re-reading material, allowing for the slow jokes to play out with more more anticipation and certainly with more perspective to better take in the instant shifts betweens characters and timelines.</p>

      <p>Finally, finally got around to reading this after letting it languish on my Kindle for several years. Recommended by both my wife and best friend, I'm glad to say that it read fast and well worth the effort.</p>
